TeleFam
=======

SuperEasy Desktop interface for old members of your family. Designed for a TV and a Raspberry Pi. 

If your loved relatives (or even your mother in law) live far away from home, and they do not
know a word of Internet, computers, smartphones, mouses... give them TeleFam!

With TeleFam on their TV you can send them messages, meetings, photos, videos, and they will enjoy a super 
simple interface joystick remote. 
 
No tech-knowledge needed!
No maintenance!
No strange questions!
No virus!
No danger!

Ok, they will not be able to design and render 3d models, play hi-definition wargames, or build one million
rows spreadsheets, but do they really need it?

You can install it on a normal computer, but TeleFam has been designed for a TV and one of those awesome
and cheap computers, the "Raspberry-Pi". Find more about this marvel in http://www.raspberrypi.org/ and try
to sink your claws on one of them as soon as possible!
